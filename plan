OBV (on balance volume): 
    check if it is a new day with datetime
    If it is a new day or new boot:
        request past 3 days of trading volume + closing value
        calculate OBV for past 3 days:
                                {volume, if closing cur > closing prev
            OBVcur = OBVprev +  {0, if closing cur = closing prev
                                {-volume, if closing cur < closing prev
        keep in variables d1, d2, d3
        use numpy.polyfit function to calculate slope of OBV line of best fit
        store slope in OBVS variable

Accumulation / distribution line:
    MFM (money flow multiplier) = [(C - L) - (H - C)] / (H - L)
    MFV (money flow volume) = Volume for the specific period * MFM
    request 3x:
        C = closing price
        L = lowest price
        H = highest price
    calculate 3 MFVs and store in mfv1, mfv2, mfv3
    use numpy.polyfit function to calculate slope of MFV line of best fit
    store slope in ADLS variable

If both OBVS and ADLS are positive: bullish strategy
If both OBVS and ADLS are negative: bearish strategy
If ADLS is positive and OBVS is negative: bullish divergence
If OBVS is positive and ADLS is negative: bearish divergence

// numpy.polyfit note: don't forget to use arrays as the arguments in the function

ADX (average directional index):
    use talib to calculate values
    // example code by Copilot
    import talib as tb
    import pandas as pd

    # Assume you have daily data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
    def calculate_adx(daily_data):
        h = daily_data['High'].values
        l = daily_data['Low'].values
        c = daily_data['Close'].values

        # Calculate ADX with a time period of 14 days
        adx_values = tb.ADX(h, l, c, timeperiod=14)

        return adx_values

    # Example usage:
    historical_data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')  # Load your historical data
    adx_results = calculate_adx(historical_data)

    if adx_results is below 25: there is weak or no trend
    if adx_results is between 25 to 50: not only is there a trend, but also a confirmation
    if adx_results is above 50: there is a strong trend

MACD (moving average convergance divergance):
    MACD = 12-period EMA - 26-period EMA
    Signal Line = A 9-period EMA of the MACD
